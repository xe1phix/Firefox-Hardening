* [Protocol Misidentification Made Easy with Format-Transforming Encryption](https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/494.pdf)

  * Deep packet inspection DPI technologies provide much- needed visibility and
    control of network traffic using port- independent protocol identification,
    where a network ow is labeled with its application-layer protocol based on
    packet contents. In this paper, we provide the most comprehensive evaluation
    of a large set of DPI systems from the point of view of protocol
    misidentification attacks, in which adver- saries on the network attempt to
    force the DPI to mislabel connections. Our approach uses a new cryptographic
    primitive called format-transforming encryption FTE, which extends
    conventional symmetric encryption with the ability to transform the
    ciphertext into a format of our choosing. We design an FTE-based record
    layer that can encrypt arbi- trary application-layer traffic, and we
    experimentally show that this forces misidentification for all of the
    evaluated DPI systems. This set includes a proprietary, enterprise-class DPI
    system used by large corporations and nation-states. We also show that using
    FTE as a proxy system incurs no latency overhead and as little as 16%
    bandwidth overhead compared to standard SSH tunnels. Finally, we integrate
    our FTE proxy into the Tor anonymity network and demonstrate that it evades
    real-world censorship by the Great Firewall of China.

* ['I've Got Nothing to Hide' and Other Misunderstandings of Privacy](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=998565&)

  * We live in a surveillance state. Law enforcement and intelligence agencies
    have access to a huge amount of data about us, enabling them to learn
    intimate, private details about our lives. In part, the ease with which they
    can obtain such information reflects the fact that our laws have failed to
    keep up with advances in technology. However, privacy enhancing technologies
    can offer real protections even when the law does not. That intelligence
    agencies like the NSA are able to collect records about every telephone call
    made in the United States, or engage in the bulk surveillance of Internet
    communications is only possible because so much of our data is transmitted
    in the clear. The privacy enhancing technologies required to make bulk
    surveillance impossible and targeted surveillance more difficult already
    exist. We just need to start using them.

* [Masquerade: How a Helpful Man-in-the-Middle Can Help You Evade Monitoring\** - Defcon22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KyfJW2lHtk&spfreload=1)

  * Sometimes, hiding the existence of a communication is as important as hiding
    the contents of that communication. While simple network tunneling such as
    Tor or a VPN can keep the contents of communications confidential, under
    active network monitoring or a restrictive IDS such tunnels are red flags
    which can subject the user to extreme scrutiny. Format-Transforming
    Encryption FTE can be used to tunnel traffic within otherwise innocuous
    protocols, keeping both the contents and existence of the sensitive traffic
    hidden. However, more advanced automated intrusion detection, or moderately
    sophisticated manual inspection, raise other red flags when a host reporting
    to be a laser printer starts browsing the web or opening IM sessions, or
    when a machine which appears to be a Mac laptop sends network traffic using
    Windows-specific network settings. We present Masquerade: a system which
    combines FTE and host OS profile selection to allow the user to emulate a
    user-selected operating system and application-set in network traffic and
    settings, evading both automated detection and frustrating after-the-fact
    analysis.

  * Edward Snowden has given us an unprecedented window into the NSA's
    surveillance activities. Drawing from both the Snowden documents and
    revelations from previous whistleblowers, I will describe the sorts of
    surveillance the NSA does and how it does it. The emphasis is on the
    technical capabilities of the NSA, not the politics of their actions. This
    includes how it conducts Internet surveillance on the backbone, but is
    primarily focused on their offensive capabilities: packet injection attacks
    from the Internet backbone, exploits against endpoint computers and implants
    to exfiltrate information, fingerprinting computers through cookies and
    other means, and so on. I will then talk about what sorts of countermeasures
    are likely to frustrate the NSA. Basically, these are techniques to raise
    the cost of wholesale surveillance in favor of targeted surveillance:
    encryption, target hardening, dispersal, and so on.

* [You're Leaking Trade Secrets - Defcon22 Michael Schrenk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTd5TL6_zgY)

  * Networks don't need to be hacked for information to be compromised. This is
    particularly true for organizations that are trying to keep trade secrets.
    While we hear a lot about personal privacy, little is said in regard to
    organizational privacy. Organizations, in fact, leak information at a much
    greater rate than individuals, and usually do so with little fanfare. There
    are greater consequences for organizations when information is leaked
    because the secrets often fall into the hands of competitors. This talk uses
    a variety of real world examples to show how trade secrets are leaked
    online, and how organizational privacy is compromised by seemingly innocent
    use of The Internet.

* [Decoy Routing: Toward Unblockable Internet Communication](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/foci11/tech/final_files/Karlin.pdf)

  * We present decoy routing, a mechanism capable of cir- cumventing common
    network filtering strategies. Unlike other circumvention techniques, decoy
    routing does not require a client to connect to a specific IP address (which
    is easily blocked) in order to provide circumvention. We show that if it is
    possible for a client to connect to any unblocked host/service, then decoy
    routing could be used to connect them to a blocked destination without coop-
    eration from the host. This is accomplished by placing the circumvention
    service in the network itself – where a single device could proxy traffic
    between a significant fraction of hosts – instead of at the edge.

* [obfs4 (The obfourscator)](https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfs4.git/tree/doc/obfs4-spec.txt)

  * This is a protocol obfuscation layer for TCP protocols. Its purpose is to
    keep a third party from telling what protocol is in use based on message
    contents. Unlike obfs3, obfs4 attempts to provide authentication and data
    integrity, though it is still designed primarily around providing a layer of
    obfuscation for an existing authenticated protocol like SSH or TLS.

* [obfs3 (The Threebfuscator)](https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/obfsproxy.git/tree/doc/obfs3/obfs3-protocol-spec.txt)

  * This is a protocol obfuscation layer for TCP protocols. Its purpose is to
    keep a third party from telling what protocol is in use based on message
    contents. Like obfs2, it does not provide authentication or data integrity.
    It does not hide data lengths. It is more suitable for providing a layer of
    obfuscation for an existing authenticated protocol, like SSH or TLS.

* [StegoTorus: A Camouflage Proxy for the Tor Anonymity System](https://research.owlfolio.org/pubs/2012-stegotorus.pdf)

  * Internet censorship by governments is an increasingly common practice
    worldwide. Internet users and censors are locked in an arms race: as users
    find ways to evade censorship schemes, the censors develop countermeasures
    for the evasion tactics. One of the most popular and effective circumvention
    tools, Tor, must regularly adjust its network traffic signature to remain
    usable. We present StegoTorus, a tool that comprehensively disguises Tor
    from protocol analysis. To foil analysis of packet contents, Tor’s traffic
    is steganographed to resemble an innocuous cover protocol, such as HTTP. To
    foil analysis at the transport level, the Tor circuit is distributed over
    many shorter-lived connections with per-packet characteristics that mimic
    cover-protocol traffic. Our evaluation demonstrates that StegoTorus improves
    the resilience of Tor to fingerprinting attacks and delivers usable
    performance.

* [SkypeMorph: Protocol Obfuscation for Tor Bridges](https://www.cypherpunks.ca/~iang/pubs/skypemorph-ccs.pdf)

  * The Tor network is designed to provide users with low- latency anonymous
    communications. Tor clients build circuits with publicly listed relays to
    anonymously reach their destinations. However, since the relays are publicly
    listed, they can be easily blocked by censoring adversaries. Consequently,
    the Tor project envisioned the possibility of unlisted entry points to the
    Tor network, commonly known as bridges. We address the issue of preventing
    censors from detecting the bridges by observing the communications between
    them and nodes in their network. We propose a model in which the client
    obfuscates its messages to the bridge in a widely used protocol over the
    Inter- net. We investigate using Skype video calls as our target protocol
    and our goal is to make it difficult for the censor- ing adversary to
    distinguish between the obfuscated bridge connections and actual Skype calls
    using statistical compar- isons. We have implemented our model as a
    proof-of-concept pluggable transport for Tor, which is available under an
    open-source licence. Using this implementation we observed the obfuscated
    bridge communications and compared it with those of Skype calls and
    presented the results.

* [Protocol Misidentification Made Easy with Format-Transforming Encryption](https://kpdyer.com/publications/ccs2013-fte.pdf)

  * Deep packet inspection (DPI) technologies provide much needed visibility and
    control of network traffic using port- independent protocol identification,
    where a network flow is labeled with its application-layer protocol based on
    packet contents. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive
    evaluation of a large set of DPI systems from the point of view of protocol
    misidentification attacks, in which adver- saries on the network attempt to
    force the DPI to mislabel connections. Our approach uses a new cryptographic
    prim- itive called format-transforming encryption (FTE), which extends
    conventional symmetric encryption with the ability to transform the
    ciphertext into a format of our choosing. We design an FTE-based record
    layer that can encrypt arbitrary application-layer traffic, and we
    experimentally show that this forces misidentification for all of the
    evaluated DPI systems. This set includes a proprietary, enterprise-class DPI
    system used by large corporations and nation-states. We also show that using
    FTE as a proxy system incurs no latency overhead and as little as 16%
    bandwidth overhead compared to standard SSH tunnels. Finally, we integrate
    our FTE proxy into the Tor anonymity network and demon- strate that it
    evades real-world censorship by the Great Fire- wall of China

* [Cirripede: Circumvention Infrastructure using Router Redirection with Plausible Deniability](http://hatswitch.org/~nikita/papers/cirripede-ccs11.pdf)

  * Many users face surveillance of their Internet communications and a
    significant fraction suffer from outright blocking of certain destinations.
    Anonymous communication systems allow users to conceal the destinations they
    communicate with, but do not hide the fact that the users are using them.
    The mere use of such systems may invite suspicion, or access to them may be
    blocked. We therefore propose Cirripede, a system that can be used for
    unobservable communication with Internet destinations. Cirripede is designed
    to be deployed by ISPs; it intercepts connections from clients to
    innocent-looking desti- nations and redirects them to the true destination
    requested by the client. The communication is encoded in a way that is
    indistinguishable from normal communications to anyone without the master
    secret key, while public-key cryptogra- phy is used to eliminate the need
    for any secret information that must be shared with Cirripede users.
    Cirripede is designed to work scalably with routers that handle large
    volumes of traffic while imposing minimal over- head on ISPs and not
    disrupting existing traffic. This allows Cirripede proxies to be
    strategically deployed at central lo- cations, making access to Cirripede
    very difficult to block. We built a proof-of-concept implementation of
    Cirripede and performed a testbed evaluation of its performance proper- ties

* [TapDance: End-to-Middle Anticensorship without Flow Blocking](https://jhalderm.com/pub/papers/tapdance-sec14.pdf)

  * In response to increasingly sophisticated state-sponsored Internet
    censorship, recent work has proposed a new ap- proach to censorship
    resistance: end-to-middle proxying. This concept, developed in systems such
    as Telex, Decoy Routing, and Cirripede, moves anticensorship technology into
    the core of the network, at large ISPs outside the censoring country. In
    this paper, we focus on two technical obstacles to the deployment of certain
    end-to-middle schemes: the need to selectively block flows and the need to
    observe both directions of a connection. We propose a new construction,
    TapDance, that removes these require- ments. TapDance employs a novel
    TCP-level technique that allows the anticensorship station at an ISP to
    function as a passive network tap, without an inline blocking com- ponent.
    We also apply a novel steganographic encoding to embed control messages in
    TLS ciphertext, allowing us to operate on HTTPS connections even under
    asymmetric routing. We implement and evaluate a TapDance proto- type that
    demonstrates how the system could function with minimal impact on an ISP’s
    network operations.

* [Chipping Away at Censorship Firewalls with User-Generated Content](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/sec10/tech/full_papers/Burnett.pdf)

  * Oppressive regimes and even democratic governments restrict Internet access.
    Existing anti-censorship systems often require users to connect through
    proxies, but these systems are relatively easy for a censor to discover and
    block. This paper offers a possible next step in the cen- sorship arms race:
    rather than relying on a single system or set of proxies to circumvent
    censorship firewalls, we explore whether the vast deployment of sites that
    host user-generated content can breach these firewalls. To explore this
    possibility, we have developed Collage, which allows users to exchange
    messages through hidden chan- nels in sites that host user-generated
    content. Collage has two components: a message vector layer for embedding
    content in cover traffic; and a rendezvous mechanism to allow parties to
    publish and retrieve messages in the cover traffic. Collage uses
    user-generated content (e.g. , photo-sharing sites) as “drop sites” for
    hidden messages. To send a message, a user embeds it into cover traffic and
    posts the content on some site, where receivers retrieve this content using
    a sequence of tasks. Collage makes it difficult for a censor to monitor or
    block these messages by exploiting the sheer number of sites where users can
    exchange messages and the variety of ways that a mes- sage can be hidden.
    Our evaluation of Collage shows that the performance overhead is acceptable
    for sending small messages (e.g. , Web articles, email). We show how Collage
    can be used to build two applications: a direct messaging application, and a
    Web content delivery sys- tem

* [Unblocking the Internet: Social networks foil censors](http://kscope.news.cs.nyu.edu/pub/TR-2008-918.pdf)

  * Many countries and administrative domains exploit control over their
    communication infrastructure to censor online content. This paper presents
    the design, im plementation and evaluation of Kaleidoscope , a peer-to-peer
    system of relays that enables users within a censored domain to access
    blocked content. The main challenge facing Kaleidoscope is to resist the
    cens or’s efforts to block the circumvention system itself. Kaleidoscope
    achieves blocking-resilienc e using restricted service discovery that allows
    each user to discover a small set of unblocked relays while only exposing a
    small fraction of relays to the censor. To restrict service discovery,
    Kaleidoscope leverages a trust network where links reflects real-world
    social relationships among users and uses a limited advertisement protocol
    based on random routes to disseminate relay addresses along the trust netwo
    rk; the number of nodes reached by a relay advertisement should ideally be
    inversely proportional to the maximum fraction of infiltration and is
    independent of the network size. To increase service availa bility in large
    networks with few exit relay nodes, Kaleidoscope forwards the actual data
    traffic across multiple relay hops without risking exposure of exit relays.
    Using detailed analysis and simulations, we show that Kalei doscope
    provides > 90% service availability even under substantial infiltration
    (close to 0.5% of edges) and when only 30% of the relay nodes are online. We
    have implemented and deployed our system on a small scale serving over
    100,000 requests to 40 censored users (relatively small user base to realize
    Kaleidoscope’s anti-blocking guarantees) spread across different countries
    and administrative domains over a 6-month period

    Exitmap modules implement tasks that are run over (a subset of) all exit
    relays. If you have a background in functional programming, think of exitmap
    as a map() interface for Tor exit relays. Modules can perform any TCP-based
    networking task; fetching a web page, uploading a file, connecting to an SSH
    server, or joining an IRC channel.

* [Decentraleyes](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/decentraleyes/)

  * Protects you against tracking through "free", centralized, content delivery.
    It prevents a lot of requests from reaching networks like Google Hosted
    Libraries, and serves local files to keep sites from breaking. Complements
    regular content blockers.

* [Decentraleyes - Github](https://github.com/Synzvato/decentraleyes)

  * A web browser extension that emulates Content Delivery Networks to improve
    your online privacy. It intercepts traffic, finds supported resources
    locally, and injects them into the environment. All of this happens
    automatically, so no prior configuration is required.

* [meek](https://github.com/Yawning/meek)

  * meek is a blocking-resistant pluggable transport for Tor. It encodes a data
    stream as a sequence of HTTPS requests and responses. Requests are reflected
    through a hard-to-block third-party web server in order to avoid talking
    directly to a Tor bridge. HTTPS encryption hides fingerprintable byte
    patterns in Tor traffic.sek
